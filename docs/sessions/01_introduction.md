## Welcome! 

This is the first 'session' of the MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship (CCF) for 2022-2023.  For a description of the program and how sessions are organized, see the [CCF home page](../index.md)

The goals of this introductory session are to orient you to this program, introduce ourselves to each other, provide some background on cloud computing, set up our technology, and discuss what all of our expectations are.  

## Activities:

**Introduce yourself on Microsoft Teams**
 
You should have all been given access to a Team "MSU ICER Cloud Computing Fellowship" via your NetID.    

  * Please log in to Teams (via the web https://teams.microsoft.com/ or using the Teams client)
  * Post a new message in the "general" channel just saying "hello" and include your name, department and how you prefer to be addressed.   
  * If necessary MSU IT has documentation about MS Teams here:  [https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/](https://tech.msu.edu/technology/collaborative-tools/spartan365/)  ( the link on that page requires yet another MSU log-in)

**Confirm Access to Azure Portal**

  * Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
  * Log in with your MSU netid and password.
  * Ensure you can access the Azure main web "portal."  
  * You don't need to (and shouldn't) create any new resources or work with this website; simply confirm you have access.   You may see a list of "resources" and will introduce Azure during our first meeting. 

## Introductions

### MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship Team

  * Dr. Brian O'Shea, Director, [MSU Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research](https://icer.msu.edu) (ICER), Professor, Physics

Sponsored by ICER, MSU Office of Research and Innovation (ORI), and MSU IT Services Research Cyberinfrastructure (RCI) 

 
#### Participant Introductions & Discussion

  * About you: your preferred name and pronouns, which degree program or department if faculty. 
  * 2 minute research synopsis and methods
  * Previous experience with reseach computing including cloud computing (if any)
  * Current research computing hurdles, roadblocks, challenges & triumphs
  * Which aspect of cloud computing are you most interested in learning and using to support your research?


## Fellowship Program Overview

#### Program synopsis:

  * Fall semester materials, activities, seminars and discussions (Pat Bills):    
    * Goal, scope and expectation;
    * structure (pre-session materials and activities, "textbook");
    * in-person meeting approx bi-weekly and excluding holidays;
    * our expectations.
  * Winter/Spring semester Projects (Mahmoud Parvizi):
    * Goal, scope and expectation;
    * Proposal write-up and presentation early January;
    * Check-points to discuss progress and hurdles
    * Office hours & help
    * Final presentation during Symposium late april

Review the  "[syllabus](../index.md)" on the home page of this website for the schedule

#### Goals

**Help you get an understanding of:**

 - what is cloud computing?
 - what is cloud computing useful for? 
 - when should it use it for my research computing?
 - how can I use it?
 - Understanding of the context of the technology we are learning about.   

**Help you get some practical experience**

 - apply cloud to some aspect of your own research
 - apply cloud to generic/canned research-like problem
 
 **Non-Goals:**
 - cover all aspects of cloud - we don't cover networks for example due to time constraints
 - prepare you for a cloud computing certification (there are many existing resources for that)
 - become experts in everything cloud
 - build a dot-com empire
 

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

* [The Computing in Cloud Computing](../topics/the_computing_in_cloud_computing.md)
* [Aspects of Cloud Computing](../topics/intro_aspects_of_cloud_computing.md)
* [Introduction to Azure](../topics/introduction_to_azure.md)
* [Azure Organization](./azure_organization.md)
* [Learning how to learn about cloud](../topics/learning_how_to_learn_about_cloud.md)

## Hands-on: Using the Azure Portal

* [Interacting with Azure using the Portal web interface](../exercises/azure_portal_walkthrough.md)
* [Setting a Budget Alert Using the Azure Portal](budget_alert.md)

<!-- Log into https://portal.azure.com with your MSU NetID
 - confirm you have access to a "resource group"
     - aside: high level description of "what is a resource group?"  This is kind of like your "cloud locker"
 - understanding the navigation of the Azure portal
     - resource
     - properties pane on left side
 - find the 'budgets' section of your resource group
 - edit the budget to add an alert at 50% spend using your preferred email address -->

## Questions and Discussion

  - What things are at the top of your mind as you begin this program?  
  - Which of these topics resonates with your previous experience using computing or cloud computing (if any)?


## Readings  

  - The [NIST definition of cloud computing](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf) 
  - [Wikipedia article on cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) is actually pretty good
  - [Chapter 1: Orienting in the cloud universe](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a-book/Orienting.html) <br>from **"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Foster and Gannon**  
     ( *[Alternative link to publisher preview chapter](https://mitpress.ublish.com/ereader/239/?preview#page/1)*  )
  - [Using Cloud Computing for Academic Research](../references/DRAFT_cloud_computing_for_academic_research_parvizi_2021.pdf), Mahmoud Parvizi (draft version).   
 
 ## Optional Readings
  - Optional Historical Note [Who Coined 'Cloud Computing'?](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/) by Antonio Regalado, October 2011, MIT Technology Review
 
  - Optional [M. Armbrust et al. "Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing. Technical Report UCB/EECS-2009-28 "University of California at Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 2009 PDF](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-28.pdf} <br>
   Written only 3 years after the launch of AWS, this is very insightful discussion of the value of cloud computing
