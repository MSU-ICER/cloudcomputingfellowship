# Azure AI Services and programing with APIs

## What is AI? Class dicussion. 

 - Definitions
 - Essential Ingredients
 
Would AI as we see it today be possible without cloud computing?

 - Public AI vs Private AI: Google and Facebook have been working on this for a long time. 
 - What are the essential ingredients for 
 - 'Cloud' versus 

### AI, ML, Services via functions
Function inputs and outputs 
Simple example: linear model from least squares ( aka regression)

serverless function example?
ML is the same.   

what would it take to write simple function 


additionally can accumulate inputs that changes outputs. "session" that can retain "state"

because it's a function, can create an API interface 

because it can have an API, can create a web api.    but requires authorization.   client / server 

- aside on web apis?

now can incorporate AI functions in code or analysis with automation.  eg. given 1000 inputs ( text ), generate 1000 AI responses and analyze differences.        AI behavioral research.  

concept of AI training.   Custom training from Azure , differentiating your AI.
