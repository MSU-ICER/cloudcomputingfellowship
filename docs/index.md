# **MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship** 

## Program Summary

The program runs Fall semester through Winder/Spring semester.  

Fall semester is dedicated to learning how the cloud works.  In-person sessions are approximately bi-weekly (see schedule below).  A session includes preparatory readings and activities to orient you to the topic, followed by an in-person meeting on Friday to review the materials, seminar, provide a venue for discussion,  and hands-on activities

Winter/Spring semester is for building a project using cloud computing culminating in a symposium where you present what you've learned and built.   Winter/spring sessions are bi-weekly for presentations by the fellows on their project status, discussion on success and challenges, presentations by cloud practitioners, and for general help.  

The culmination of the fellowship is a project resulting in a write-up and presentation during the spring symposium, typically held late-April or early-May.   

## Textbook

We will occasionally link to the following book: 

**"Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", Ian Foster and Dennis B. Gannon, September 2017**

## MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship Symposium

Projects Presentations by all fellows.   Fellows are strongly encourage to invite their advisors, mentors and colleagues. 

Late April, 2024.  Date and time determined in January 2024 with input from the fellows
 
## Communications

 Fellows are encouraged to contact us with questions or if they are ever stuck on an activity we've assigned.  In addition to email, we are utilizing Microsoft Teams at MSU (Fellows receive a link in the welcome email).   Please feel free to reach on out the MS Teams channel sent to participants at the beginning of the program.  Mentioning one of us e.g. @billspat or @parvizm will help get our attention.  Additionally you may email us at any time.   
 
The goal of the fellowship is to foster discussion.  We encourage you to add your successes or challenges to any discussion or question Teams.   

If you need interactive, on-going help it may be better to schedule a help session with a fellowship coordinator; and we are happy to meet individually for additional support.   This may be especially effective when fellows are developing their projects.  

We also save time during our synchronous meetings for group discussions, so please bring any concerns, difficulties, or successes to our sessions! 

If you are not a participant but have questions about the program, see the [Contact page](contact.md) for how to get in touch with us.
